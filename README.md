# Socket Programming and Simple Web Server

## Description:

This project involves implementing network communication using socket programming without the use of libraries and developing a simple web server.
The project is divided into three parts, each focusing on different network concepts and practical applications:

## Part 1: Network Commands and Analysis

-Ping: Tests connectivity between devices on a network.

-Tracert: Traces the route packets take to a destination.

-Nslookup: Queries DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.

-Telnet: Provides a command-line interface for communication with remote devices.

#### these commands runs to capture DNS messages using Wireshark, and analyze the outputs.


## Part 2: TCP Client-Server Application

Implement a TCP client-server application using socket programming.
The server listens on port 9955 and handles messages containing student IDs, responding with actions like locking the screen.


## Part 3: Simple Web Server

Create a web server using socket programming that listens on port 9966.
The server will handle various HTTP requests, serving HTML and CSS files, and managing redirects based on the request paths.
